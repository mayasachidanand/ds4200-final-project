    <h1> An Analysis of Electric Vehicles in the State of Washington</h1>

    <h3>Project Introduction</h3>

    <p> With the worsening effects of climate change and global warming becoming 
        greatly apparent, people are looking for ways that they can individually 
        reduce their carbon footprint. According to the research article
        <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.896547/full">“Electric 
        Vehicle Modelling for Future Technology and Market Penetration Analysis”</a>, the 
        transportation sector is responsible for up to 25% of greenhouse gas emissions 
        globally. In the United States of America, cars are the primary mode of 
        transportation, and contribute to pollution through the emission of carbon 
        dioxide, a particularly harmful greenhouse gas. 
    </p>

    <p> To combat this issue, electric vehicles (EVs) have surged in popularity nationally, as
        EVs utilize batteries or other sustainable fuel sources that avoid the carbon dioxide 
        emissions of traditional cars. Due to the increasing prevalence of EVs in the world, 
        questions have arisen as to the timeline and practicality of a mainstream adoption of EVs, 
        and how this transition will be imposed through policymaking. Current utilization of EVs 
        act as guides for consumer interests in the field, and identifies areas of concern in terms
        of implementation, consumer acceptance, and accessibility. 
    </p>


    <h3>Introduction to the Data</h3>

    <p> This project utilizes the "Electric Vehicle Population Dataset" from Kaggle. This 
        data set is updated annually and draws its data from the Washington State Department
        of Licensing (DOL). It can be used to draw insights from electric vehicle usage in 
        the state, and how those findings may apply nationally to improve sustainability. 
        The data includes 17 columns and 166,800 rows. Of the 17 columns, 15 columns 
        represent categorical data, while 2 columns represent continuous data. Detailed 
        information about the features are listed in the following table:

        <p> While analyzing datasets where location plays a significant role, it is important to 
            visualize data according to its geographical information. Since our data focuses on 
            Washington state and provides the county of each registered vehicle, we utilized 
            geographical data from <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a>.
            Following is a choropleth map utilizing geographic counties data and our dataset.
        </p>

            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> Our choropleth map illustrates the prevalence of electric vehicles in 
                    the different counties in Washington State, where darker regions indicates
                    higher prevalence, and lighter regions indicates lower prevalence. This 
                    visualization provides an overview of the location of our data and the 
                    overall distribution of all registered electric vehicles.

        <h3>Popularity of Electric Vehicle Types</h3>

        <div class = 'text'>
            <p> Furthermore, we also want to explore the type of electric vehicle
                that holds popularity within the state. As described in the attributes
                table above, an EV can be classified as either a "Battery Electric Vehicle"
                or a "Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle". A <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/how-do-all-electric-cars-work">
                Battery Electric Vehicle</a> is an EV that has an electric motor instead of a combustion engine, and is powered
                solely by a battery pack. A <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric-basics-phev">Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle</a> 
                is an EV that has an electric motor powered by a battery, as well as a combustion 
                engine powered by another fuel source, such as gasoline. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="displot.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>   

        <div class = 'text'>
            <p> The stacked bar chart above depicts the distribution of vehicle types for the ten counties
                with the highest number of registered electric vehicles. The visualization includes 
                a tooltip feature that allows users to hover over the blue or red region of the bar and 
                see the Electric Vehicle Type, County, and the number of EVs of that type registered in 
                the county. Across all ten counties, the Battery Electric Vehicle tends to be more 
                popular than the Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle. This information may be helpful for 
                EV manufacturers to understand what Electric Vehicle Types are most popular amongst consumers
                and strive to meet demand. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Moreover, King County has significantly more electric vehicles than any other county; 
                interestingly, King County is also the wealthiest county in the state and it encompasses 
                the most highly populated city, Seattle. While the high number of registrations may 
                correlate primarily with the large population of Seattle, socioeconomic status may also 
                play a factor. Electric vehicles can be expensive, and out of budget for those in less wealthy
                counties. Thus, if state governments would like to increase electric vehicle use for sustainability
                reasons, they may consider subsidizing vehicles or targeting legislation promoting electric vehicles
                to counties with lower EV registrations. 
            </p>

        <h3>Locations of Registered Electric Vehicles State-Wide</h3>
        
        <div class = 'container container2'>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>
                    Although understanding distributions of EVs by county is important, especially in understanding
                    regional differences, counties can be large areas of land where distribution is not even. For that reason,
                    it is important to observe the specific locations of electric vehicles in our dataset, as depicted 
                    in the map below:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = 'center'>
                <iframe src="interactive-map.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>
                    In this interactive visualization, each dot represents a registered EV in the state of Washington, 
                    and clicking on a dot produces a popup for the user to view the Make and Model of the vehicle. 
                    This map plots the coordinates of where each car is registered by latitude and longitude. Distribution 
                    is concentrated strongly around major Washington cities such as Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, Olympia, 
                    Yakima, Bremerton, Vancouver, and Spokane. We can see that for certain counties that appeared to 
                    have high concentrations of EVs in the choropleth map, many of the vehicles were actually 
                    concentrated in a city in the county, while the rest of the county has sparse distributions. 
                    This distinction is vital, as it may provide local district lawmakers insight on where charging
                    stations may need to be installed or where accessibility to chargers may be improved. 
                </p>

        <h3>Price Points for Electric Vehicles</h3>

        <div class = 'container container3'>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>
                    As mentioned previously, a major obstacle to broad use of electric vehicles is the price point. 
                    There is a public conception, which is sometimes true, that EVs are more expensive to purchase
                    than a typical gasoline fueled car. However, there is a different cost efficiency to EVs than 
                    normal cars; despite the purchasing cost of the vehicle itself, owners save money on gas, and 
                    do not have to worry about fickle gas prices that may change with the state of the economy. 
                    Regardless, initial cost still matters to consumers, and our graph below aims to make buyers
                    aware of the various Base MSRPs for the top five most common Makes in Washington.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = 'center'>
                <iframe src="altair-bar (1).html" width="550px" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>
                    In this graph, the number of data points at each Base MSRP is plotted. Since Makes often have 
                    unique features that place their products at different price points, we are able to color 
                    each bar by which Make sells vehicles at that MSRP. The presence of multiple bars of the 
                    same color indicates the range of price points within the same manufacturer. We offer tooltip and
                    interactivity that allows users to select a bar and gray out the rest of the bars, in order to 
                    focus on the popularity of a vehicle at that Base MSRP value. This visualization allows 
                    buyers to view how affordable electric vehicles are for electric vehicles, and how accessible each
                    car is to the average consumer.
                </p>

        <h3>Value of Electric Vehicles</h3>

        <div class = 'container container4'>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>
                    Although price is a crucial factor in car purchasing decisions, other aspects of the vehicle
                    also hold importance. The range of the vehicle, describes how far a car can travel on a tank
                    of gas (for fuel-based vehicles) or on a full charge of the battery (for electric vehicles).
                    Concerns about how electric range compares to fuel range have proven to be important in the 
                    electric vehicle discussion, as shown through <a href="https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2516&context=etd">
                    research by CSU San Bernardino</a>. Ideally, the best value of an EV would have a lower Base MSRP 
                    and higher electric range. The visualization below demonstrates the value of various EVs:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = 'image'>
                <img src="d3graph.png" width="800px" height="500px" frameborder="0"></img>
            </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>
                    This scatter plot demonstrates the relationship between Base MSRP and Electric Range for 
                    the top seven Makes in the dataset. Different points of the same color represent different
                    models from the same Make. Additionally, the more opaque a point, the more popular that model
                    is in the dataset. 

                    As seen through the visualization, many Makes have models with varying values. Chrysler, Mini,
                    and Subaru models have both low Base MSRPs and low electric range, while BMW and Volvo models
                    display poor value, with high Base MSRPs and low electric ranges. KIA has models that are 
                    good value, with medium-high electric ranges for low Base MSRPs. Tesla stands out from the 
                    other Makes with extremely high electric range, though all have medium-high Base MSRPs. This 
                    visualization should help buyers to evaluate their budgets and their personal priorities for 
                    a car before making a purchase. 
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Conclusion and Future Work</h3>

        <p>
            Through this visualization analysis of our data, we addressed a variety of groups within the 
            electric vehicle field. For buyers, we offer information for them to assess price levels, make, 
            and electric range, in order to provide a guide for purchasing an EV. For manufacturers, we highlighted
            the types of electric vehicles that customers are interested in and the areas of the state where
            they might focus advertising efforts. For legislators, we demonstrated areas of inequality where
            efforts to improve accessibility could drastically increase EV use, and lower carbon emissions. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            From these visualizations, we hope that we may influence people to seriously consider electric 
            vehicles in their transportation decisions. This could help contribute to an overall global 
            sustainability initiative. With the rise and popularity of electric cars such as Tesla, it is 
            very possible that EVs can see an exponential increase in purchases.
        </p> 
            
        <p>
            Future work could explore EVs in a national or global context, and how consumers demographic 
            information correlates with EV use. Although an effective basis for the start of our research,
            Washington cannot act as a benchmark for the entire United States of America, and insights from 
            one state may not apply to others. Our analysis of the data can also help future work determine 
            how and where to market electric vehicles to guarantee the most success for automotive companies.
