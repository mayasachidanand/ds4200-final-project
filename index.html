    <h1> An Analysis of Electric Vehicles in the State of Washington</h1>

    <h3>Project Introduction</h3>

    <p> With the worsening effects of climate change and global warming becoming 
        greatly apparent, people are looking for ways that they can individually 
        reduce their carbon footprint. According to the research article
        <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.896547/full">“Electric 
        Vehicle Modelling for Future Technology and Market Penetration Analysis”</a>, the 
        transportation sector is responsible for up to 25% of greenhouse gas emissions 
        globally. In the United States of America, cars are the primary mode of 
        transportation, and contribute to pollution through the emission of carbon 
        dioxide, a particularly harmful greenhouse gas. 
    </p>

    <p> To combat this issue, electric vehicles (EVs) have surged in popularity nationally, as
        EVs utilize batteries or other sustainable fuel sources that avoid the carbon dioxide 
        emissions of traditional cars. Due to the increasing prevalence of EVs in the world, 
        questions have arisen as to the timeline and practicality of a mainstream adoption of EVs, 
        and how this transition will be imposed through policymaking. Current utilization of EVs 
        act as guides for consumer interests in the field, and identifies areas of concern in terms
        of implementation, consumer acceptance, and accessibility.

    <h3>Introduction to the Data</h3>

    <p> This project utilizes the "Electric Vehicle Population Dataset" from Kaggle. This 
        data set is updated annually and draws its data from the Washington State Department
        of Licensing (DOL). It can be used to draw insights from electric vehicle usage in 
        the state, and how those findings may apply nationally to improve sustainability. 
        The data includes 17 columns and 166,800 rows. Of the 17 columns, 15 columns 
        represent categorical data, while 2 columns represent continuous data. Detailed 
        information about the features are listed in the following table:

        <p> While analyzing datasets where location plays a significant role, it is important to 
            visualize data according to its geographical information. Since our data focuses on 
            Washington state and provides the county of each registered vehicle, we utilized 
            geographical data from <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a>.
            Following is a choropleth map utilizing geographic counties data and our dataset.
        </p>

        <div class = 'container container1'>

            </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> Our choropleth map illustrates the prevalence of electric vehicles in 
                    the different counties in Washington State, where darker regions indicates
                    higher prevalence, and lighter regions indicates lower prevalence. This 
                    visualization provides an overview of the location of our data and the 
                    overall distribution of all registered electric vehicles.

        <h3>Registered Electric Vehicles State-Wide</h3>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <h3>Popularity of Electric Vehicle Types</h3>

        <div class = 'text'>
            <p> Furthermore, we also want to explore the type of electric vehicle
                that holds popularity within the state. As described in the attributes
                table above, an EV can be classified as either a "Battery Electric Vehicle"
                or a "Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle". A <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/how-do-all-electric-cars-work">
                Battery Electric Vehicle</a> is an EV that has an electric motor instead of a combustion engine, and is powered
                solely by a battery pack. A <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric-basics-phev">Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle</a> 
                is an EV that has an electric motor powered by a battery, as well as a combustion 
                engine powered by another fuel source, such as gasoline. 
            </p>

            <p> This bar chart depicts the distribution of vehicle types for the ten counties
                with the highest number of registered electric vehicles. King County has 
                significantly more electric vehicles than any other county; interestingly, 
                King County is also the wealthiest county in the state and it encompasses the
                most highly populated city (Seattle). While the high number of registrations may 
                correlate primarily with the large population of Seattle, socioeconomic status 
                may also correspond with electric vehicle prevalence. Thus, if state or local 
                governments would like to increase electric vehicle use for sustainability reasons,
                they may consider subsidizing these vehicles or exploring other avenues to increase
                accessibility.

        <h3>Compare MA to the other states</h3>

        <p>
            Since we are in MA, thus we want to take a closer look between
            MA and other states. We create the following interactive plot
            such that user can choose another state to compare with MA and 
            show the bar plot on each factors.

        <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

        <p>
            In this visualization analysis, we try to explore the US 
            unemployment rate across states. We also examine the relation
            between unemployment rate and other social factors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, this is the 2010 data thus may be different 
            than the current economics status. Also, unemployment rate 
            may fluctuate seasonally thus adding a time series analysis
            will be more informative.
