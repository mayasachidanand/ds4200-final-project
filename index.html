    <h1> An Analysis of Electric Vehicles in the State of Washington</h1>

    <h3>Project Introduction</h3>

    <p> With the worsening effects of climate change and global warming becoming 
        greatly apparent, people are looking for ways that they can individually 
        reduce their carbon footprint. According to the research article
        <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.896547/full">“Electric 
        Vehicle Modelling for Future Technology and Market Penetration Analysis”</a>, the 
        transportation sector is responsible for up to 25% of greenhouse gas emissions 
        globally. In the United States of America, cars are the primary mode of 
        transportation, and contribute to pollution through the emission of carbon 
        dioxide, a particularly harmful greenhouse gas. 
    </p>

    <p> To combat this issue, electric vehicles (EVs) have surged in popularity nationally, as
        EVs utilize batteries or other sustainable fuel sources that avoid the carbon dioxide 
        emissions of traditional cars. Due to the increasing prevalence of EVs in the world, 
        questions have arisen as to the timeline and practicality of a mainstream adoption of EVs, 
        and how this transition will be imposed through policymaking. Current utilization of EVs 
        act as guides for consumer interests in the field, and identifies areas of concern in terms
        of implementation, consumer acceptance, and accessibility. 
    </p>


    <h3>Introduction to the Data</h3>

    <p> This project utilizes the "Electric Vehicle Population Dataset" from Kaggle. This 
        data set is updated annually and draws its data from the Washington State Department
        of Licensing (DOL). It can be used to draw insights from electric vehicle usage in 
        the state, and how those findings may apply nationally to improve sustainability. 
        The data includes 17 columns and 166,800 rows. Of the 17 columns, 15 columns 
        represent categorical data, while 2 columns represent continuous data. Detailed 
        information about the features are listed in the following table:

        <p>Meanwhile, we also believe that the geographical 
            information is important when evaluating the unemployment
            rate. Therefore, we also make use of geographical information 
            on <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a>. 
            The website provides the geographical information for making maps for US states. 
        </p>

        <p>To make a better data visualization, we remove the Alaska and Hawaii
            from the data. Following is an interactive map for the 
            lower 48 states in US. User can zoom in the map. The color
            indicates the unemployment rate for each state. When click any 
            state, other social factors will be revealed for the state. </p>

            </div>
            
            <p>In general, west coast states tend to have higher 
                unemployment rate. On the east coast, West virginia 
                and New York state tend to have higher unemplyment rate
                than the others. In the south, Mississippi and Louisiana
                are the ones with the much higher unemplyment rate.
            </p>

        <h3>Overview of the Unemployment rate</h3>
        
        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class = 'image'>
                <!-- <iframe src="histogram/index.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>-->
                <iframe src="histogram/finish.png" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> First, we present an overview of the unemployment rate
                    for all 50 states. Alaska is the one with the 
                    highest unemployment rate, which may due to the seasonal 
                    business in the state. The effectiveness of labor market 
                    policies and governance structures can influence unemployment 
                    rates. Washington, D.C., being the seat of government, may 
                    experience fluctuations in employment related to government 
                    spending and policies. Mississippi and Louisiana have economies 
                    that are heavily reliant on sectors such as agriculture, 
                    manufacturing, and energy. Economic downturns or fluctuations 
                    in these industries can impact employment opportunities. 
                    Connecticut, South Dakota and Virginia have the lowest 
                    unemplyment rate. These states often have diverse economies 
                    with strong sectors such as technology, healthcare, finance, 
                    and tourism. A diverse economy can provide more resilience to 
                    economic downturns.

        <h3> The relationship between unemployment rate and other social factors</h3>

        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>Moreover, we also want to examine the relationship between
                    unemployment rate and other social factors in the data. All 
                    features are numerical thus we firts create a correlation
                    plot to examine whether there are linear relationship between 
                    unemployment rate with other social factors. Notice that if 
                    the correlation is small, it only means that there is no potential
                    linear relationship between two features. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the correlation plot, among all the features, poverty 
                    has the strongest correlation with the unemployment rate since
                    they are both related to the economics. The percentage of single 
                    parents is the second important feature which inidicates the 
                    stability of family is also strongly related to the job market. 
                    The increase of unemployment rate may also related to the increase 
                    of violent crime and murder rate but has a negative relationship
                    with education indicators, like the percentage of people who go to
                    high school and college. The only variable that has no direct linear
                    relation with the unemployment rate is Metropolitan, which means the 
                    percent of residents living in a metropolitan area. 
                </p>

            </div>   
        </div>

        <p>We have also create an interactive scatter plot so that 
            our users can select a couple of states within
            a certain range of unemployment rate and to see how the 
            other factors may be related here. 
        </p>

        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="scatter.html" width="85%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>Compare MA to the other states</h3>

        <p>
            Since we are in MA, thus we want to take a closer look between
            MA and other states. We create the following interactive plot
            such that user can choose another state to compare with MA and 
            show the bar plot on each factors. 
        </p>

        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="summary.html" width="95%" height="300px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

        <p>
            In this visualization analysis, we try to explore the US 
            unemployment rate across states. We also examine the relation
            between unemployment rate and other social factors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, this is the 2010 data thus may be different 
            than the current economics status. Also, unemployment rate 
            may fluctuate seasonally thus adding a time series analysis
            will be more informative.
